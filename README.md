# C# Realistic Procedural Terrain - Unity 5

Contains project files for Unity 5 Realistic Procedural Terrain

	  I wanted to use my knowledge of procedural and a udemy tutorial to create realistic looking procedural landscapes. In 
    this course, Penny introduces procedural terrain generation techniques using her internationally acclaimed holistic 
    teaching style and expertise from over 25 years of teaching, research and work in games and computer graphics. Throughout 
    the course you will follow along with hands-on workshops, designed to teach you the fundamental techniques used for 
    generating realistic virtual landscapes.

**Looking for a step by step guide?** Check out 
Sam Pattuzzi's **[Procedural Terrain Generation with Unity](https://www.udemy.com/course/procedural-terrain-generation-with-unity)!** The course begins by examining the nature of a landscape and the design considerations you should include in making decisions on structure, colour and vegetation. You'll learn what makes for a natural looking terrain, so you can replicate this in Unity.
